Welcome to Cliques!

Cliques is a Reddit-esque social media site, built with Ruby on Rails, Hotwire and Tailwind CSS as well as a variety of other tools and technologies.

The website is organized into social groups called "Cliques" which are invite-only. Users that are members of a clique can make posts, leave comments, and vote on content within the Clique. Users who are not members will be able to view content, however unless a user has a membership all content will be anonymous inside the Clique.

On the front page, content from Cliques will be displayed depending on how popular the Post is, but also by the reputation score of the Clique which is affected by the vote totals of that Clique's content. Cliques that have content that is negatively received by the community will be 'weighed down' on your main feed. Viewing content inside of a Clique works similarly except that instead of the Clique's reputation score, it will be weighed by the post author's reputation score. Cliques provides some anonymity but content can still be adjudicated by the broader community.
